**StayTrack - Employee Retention Predictor - Requirements Document**

The Employee Retention Model is designed to analyze employee data and predict the likelihood of attrition based on various factors. This document outlines the technical and data requirements necessary to develop and deploy the model.

## **Environment Setup**
- A Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.
- Google Drive integration (if using Colab) for dataset storage and retrieval.

## **Required Libraries and Dependencies**
The following Python libraries are required for data processing, visualization, and machine learning modeling:

- **Data Processing**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `numpy` - Numerical operations
- **Visualization**:
  - `matplotlib` - Basic plotting
  - `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
- **Machine Learning & Evaluation**:
  - `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`):
    - `StandardScaler` for feature scaling
    - `train_test_split` for dataset splitting
    - `cross_val_score`, `GridSearchCV` for model tuning
    - `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `XGBoost` for classification
    - Performance metrics: `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `f1_score`, `roc_auc_score`, `roc_curve`
  - `imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE` - Handling class imbalance

## **Data Requirements**
- **Dataset Name**: `Train.csv`
- **Data Storage**: Local directory or Google Drive
- **Features**:
  - Employee demographics (e.g., Age, Gender, Education Level)
  - Job-related attributes (e.g., Job Role, Department, Salary, Work Experience)
  - Performance indicators (e.g., Appraisal Score, Promotion History)
- **Target Variable**: Employee Attrition (Yes/No)

## **Data Preprocessing**
- Load dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Drop unnecessary columns (`Employee_ID`).
- Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
- Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
- Normalize/standardize numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
- Apply `SMOTE` to handle class imbalance.

## **Model Development**
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- **Training and Validation**:
  - Split dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
  - Perform cross-validation using `cross_val_score`.
  - Tune hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`.

## **Model Evaluation**
- Performance Metrics:
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - Accuracy Score
  - ROC-AUC Score
  - ROC Curve Analysis
- Feature importance analysis to identify key factors affecting retention.

## **Expected Output and Insights**
- Visualization of model evaluation results.
- Identification of high-risk employees based on prediction scores.
- Recommendations for improving employee retention based on key influencing factors.

## **Deployment Considerations**
- The model can be integrated into an HR analytics dashboard.
- API development for real-time employee attrition prediction.
- Continuous retraining based on updated employee data.
